# Simutrans GL

Simutrans GL is a fork of [Simutrans](https://github.com/simutrans/simutrans) which uses Open GL to display the game and Open AL to play sounds. Long term goals of the project are to migrate the graphics pipeline to full 32bpp and to make use of Open GLs blending and texture scaling capabilities.
